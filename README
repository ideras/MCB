MCB Generator and Autoleveller
by Ivan de Jesus Deras (2013, ideras@gmail.com)

This program includes the following modules:

1. Gerber to GCode: This module basically uses pcb2gcode to generate gcode from gerber files. 
2. Autoleveller: This modules is able to read GCode produced by pcb-gcode (Eagle plugin) or pcb2gcode etch file and add gcode to probe the board beforehand, then adjust milling depth to compensate for board/table height variations.

3. 2D GCode Backplotter: This module is able to parse GCode produced pcb-probe (Eagle plugin), pcb2gcode and even Autoleveller output, and is able to plot the resulting gcode including the probe points.  This is useful for debugging purposes.

The program uses QT for the GUI, is has been tested on Windows and Linux, and it should work on MacOS (because there's a QT version for MAC).
The licence used for the program is GPL version 3.

Note: MCB stands for Milled Circuit Board.
